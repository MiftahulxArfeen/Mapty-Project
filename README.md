# 🗺️ Mapty – Workout Tracker on Interactive Maps

**Mapty** is a project I built while learning advanced JavaScript. It’s a simple but fun workout tracker where you can log **running** and **cycling** workouts right on an interactive map. It uses **geolocation** to detect your position, **Leaflet.js** for maps, and stores all workouts in **local storage** so they stay saved even after you close the app.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 📍 Uses the **Geolocation API** to fetch your location  
- 🗺️ Interactive map with **Leaflet.js**  
- 🏃 Log **running workouts** (distance, duration, pace, cadence)  
- 🚴 Log **cycling workouts** (distance, duration, speed, elevation)  
- 💾 Saves all workouts in **local storage**  
- 🔄 Sidebar list + map markers stay in sync  
- 🎯 Click a workout in the list to zoom into its map location

## 🧠 What I Practiced and Learned

This project really helped me practice:  

- Working with the **Geolocation API**  
- Adding **interactive maps** with Leaflet.js  
- Storing and retrieving data from **local storage**  
- Writing **object-oriented JavaScript (ES6 classes)**  
- Building and following a **project architecture/flowchart**  
- Handling forms and making them dynamic based on user input  

It gave me a feel of how a small real-world app can be structured and how different browser APIs fit together.

## 🙋 About the Project

This app was inspired by workout trackers like Strava. The idea was to practice **JavaScript, browser APIs, and object-oriented programming** by building something that feels useful and fun.  

I enjoyed working on the mapping feature the most — seeing workouts appear on the map felt very rewarding. The biggest challenge for me was handling the local storage and keeping the map and list in sync, but solving that gave me a much clearer understanding of how to persist data in web apps.  

🕒 I built it as part of my frontend learning journey, and it’s one of my favorite projects so far.
